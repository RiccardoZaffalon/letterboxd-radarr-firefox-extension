# Letterboxd To Radarr

A minimalistic browser extension that adds a utility button to add movies from Letterboxd to Radarr.

The button is a shortcut link to your Radarr's "Add New" page with the search query prefilled with the movie's TMDB ID. From there you can select and manually add it to your catalog with your preferred settings.

Auto-download is not currently part of this extension, but could be achieved via Radarr's APIs. This is simply a shortcut to avoid searching for the same movie on two platforms.
